# SpringDemo
This project is a simple implementation of the JDBC aspect of Spring framework. 
In the dao package, I have all relevant classes and interface for data operations of a table called namelist storing students'
info in a database called namedb. In the pkg package I have the main class which builds up a context and adds a new student to namelist. 
In Beans.xml I set up all necessary xml tags for dependency injection and beans creation.
